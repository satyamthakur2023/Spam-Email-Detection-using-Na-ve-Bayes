# 📧 Spam SMS Detection Using Naïve Bayes

## 📝 Overview

This project uses the **UCI Spam SMS Dataset** to build a spam detection model using **Multinomial Naïve Bayes**, a probabilistic machine learning algorithm ideal for text classification. The goal is to classify SMS messages as either **spam** or **ham** (not spam).

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository (original `spam.csv`)
- **Features:**
  - `v1`: Label (`ham` or `spam`)
  - `v2`: SMS message text

---

## 🧪 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Regular Expressions (re)

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

1. Dropped irrelevant or missing rows
2. Renamed columns: `v1` ➝ `label`, `v2` ➝ `message`
3. Converted all messages to lowercase
4. Removed non-alphabetic characters
5. Applied whitespace normalization

## ⚙️ Feature Extraction

Used **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to convert text into numeric vectors:
- Removed English stop words
- Limited features to 3000 most important words

---

## 🧠 Model

- **Classifier:** Multinomial Naïve Bayes
- **Why:** Efficient and accurate for text classification with word counts or TF-IDF scores

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy Score**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
- **Classification Report**

Example Output:
Accuracy: 97.89%

Classification Report: precision recall f1-score support

## 🧾 How to Run

1. Upload `spam.csv` to Google Colab or link via Google Drive.
2. Run each step of the notebook sequentially.
3. Observe the output metrics to evaluate model performance.

## 📈 Possible Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning
- Deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)
- Deploy with Gradio or Streamlit as a web app
- Add confusion matrix visualization

## ✅ Conclusion

The Naïve Bayes model achieves strong performance with simple preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization. It’s an efficient solution for real-time SMS spam detection.
