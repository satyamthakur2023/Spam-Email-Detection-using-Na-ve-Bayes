# Spam Email Detection using Naïve Bayes

Welcome to the **Spam Email Detection using Naïve Bayes** repository! This project is part of a college assignment to classify emails as spam or non-spam using the Naïve Bayes algorithm in Python.

## Project Overview

Spam detection is a vital aspect of email management, ensuring users receive only genuine messages. The goal of this project is to implement the Naïve Bayes algorithm for effective spam classification.

## Features
- **Dataset Collection:** Utilize a labeled dataset for spam email classification (e.g., [Enron Dataset](www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) or other publicly available datasets).
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset to remove noise and prepare it for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction:** Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant features such as word frequencies, TF-IDF scores, and more.
- **Naïve Bayes Model:** Implement and train the Naïve Bayes algorithm for email classification.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
